# Assignment 0: Environment Setup & Hello World (C)

This is Assignment 0 for the course, designed to help you get familiar with GitHub Classroom, Git workflows, and C programming.  
You will write a simple C program that prints `"Hello, World!"` to the terminal and pass an automated test.

## The Assignment

Write a C program that outputs the following **exact** line: "Hello, World!"

The program should be written in a file named `main.c`.  
When compiled and run, it should produce exactly one line of output with a newline at the end.

## Setup Command

N/A â€” no special setup is required.

## Run Command

```bash
make test

```
## Notes
You must use printf("Hello, World!\n"); in your main.c file to match the expected output exactly.

Compilation is handled using gcc via the Makefile.

Make sure your program does not prompt for input or produce extra output.

This assignment ensures you have a working development environment and understand the GitHub Classroom submission process.

## Submission
Push your changes to GitHub to trigger the autograder. You should see feedback within a few minutes.
Good luck and welcome to the course!
